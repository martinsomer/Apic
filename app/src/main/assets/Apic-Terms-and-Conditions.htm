apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully
before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part
of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the

and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any
reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it

provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to
keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you
do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the
Apic app won’t work properly or at all.</span></p>

color:#616161'>You should be aware that there are certain things that Frost
Studios will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will
require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be
Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Frost Studios cannot
take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t
have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</span></p>

color:#616161'>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile
provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while
accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use
the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning
off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
from the bill payer for using the app.</span></p>

responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your
device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
avail the Service, Frost Studios cannot accept responsibility.</span></p>

the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that
although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we
do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it
available to you. Frost Studios accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of
the app.</span></p>

currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for both systems
(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
using the app. Frost Studios does not promise that it will always update the
app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version
that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop
providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will
end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
device.</span></p>
